== A More Practical Arrangement <PratArrang>

It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics – as usually understood 
at the present time – when applied to moving bodies, leads to 
asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena.

--- A. Einstein, 1905
]

In the first section of his 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of 
Moving Bodies" Einstein noted that we could assign to each event 
the time reading of a clock resting at the origin of a system of 
spatial coordinates when light from that event reaches the clock, 
but this has the disadvantage of making the time coordinates 
dependent on the choice of spatial origin. The same would be true 
if we assigned the reading of the clock to each event when light 
from the clock reaches that event. These methods give time 
coordinates that are offset – either leading or lagging – by the 
light transit time to or from the origin. We could eliminate the 
dependence on the choice of spatial origin by taking the average of 
the two, i.e., assigning the origin clock time to each event that 
is temporally half-way between the leading and lagging events at 
any fixed spatial location. However, this is valid only if the 
speed of light (or, more generally, the signal) is isotropic in 
terms of those coordinates. According to Lorentz, this would apply 
only for a system of coordinates at rest in the ether, and he 
regarded the time coordinate of this system as the “true” time 
coordinate for all other systems as well, even though his theory 
implied that those other systems would not constitute inertial 
coordinate systems, because mechanical inertia would not be 
isotropic in terms of those systems. In his 1905 paper, Einstein 
said "We arrive at a much more practical arrangement by means of 
the following considerations".


Einstein argued that what Lorentz regarded as artificial coordinate 
systems (in terms of which Maxwell’s equations are invariant) are 
none other than the actual inertial coordinate systems, meaning 
they are the systems of coordinates in which the equations of 
Newtonian mechanics hold good “to the first approximation” (i.e., 
in the low speed limit). To deduce the relationship between such 
coordinate systems he proceeded quite differently from Lorentz, 
basing his argument on much simpler and more fundamental principles.
 

First he described an operational way of establishing an inertial 
coordinate system, including the time coordinate (although he 
originally referred to time verbally as a separate parameter rather 
than as a fourth coordinate). As discussed in Section 1.3, the 
inertia-based coordinate systems of Galileo and Newton had always 
included an operational definition of the time coordinate, 
necessary to make mechanical inertia isotropic (equal action and 
reaction), but too little attention had been paid to this. Einstein 
contributed to the eventual clarification of this fact, although he 
did so by using light signals to synchronize separate clocks, which 
made it easily confused with Poincare’s earlier comments about the 
correspondence between Lorentz’s local time and the time given by 
light synchronization. This by itself is circular, because 
Lorentz’s local time is defined as the time necessary for Maxwell’s 
equations to hold good, which automatically entails that light 
speed is isotropic in terms of those coordinates. Thus Poincare’s 
observation, although suggestive, did not actually add anything 
substantially new to the understanding of the physical 
significance of Lorentz’s local time.

 

In contrast, Einstein’s presentation entails that mechanical 
inertia is isotropic in terms of those same coordinates, and hence 
those systems really are the inertia-based systems. This point was 
somewhat obscured in his 1905 paper by his decision to use light 
signals, although in later writings he acknowledged that any 
inertially symmetrical signals – such as pairs of identical 
material objects acting against each other with equal force from 
rest in opposite directions – can be used. (The special attribute 
of light in this regard is that it has no mass and therefore no 
rest frame, so we can dispense with the “from rest” condition.)


Having clarified (to an extent) the operational meaning of inertia-
based coordinate systems, Einstein then expressed two empirically-
based principles on which his derivation of the Lorentz 
transformation would be based:

1. The laws by which the conditions of physical systems change are independent of which of two coordinate systems in homogeneous translational movement relative to each other these changes in status are referred. 

2. Each ray of light moves in "the resting" coordinate system with the definite speed c, independently of whether this ray of light is emitted from a resting or moving body. Here speed = (optical path) / (length of time), where "length of time" is to be understood in the sense of the definition in § l.

In the first of these propositions the “coordinate systems” must 
be the inertia-based systems discussed above, because without this 
stipulation, the proposition is false. For example, coordinate 
systems related by Galilean transformations are “in homogeneous 
translational movement relative to each other”, and yet the laws 
by which physical systems change (e.g., Maxwell’s equations) are 
manifestly not independent of the choice of such coordinate 
systems. So the restriction to coordinate systems in terms of 
which the homogeneous and isotropic equations of mechanics hold 
good is essential. However, once we have imposed this restriction, 
the proposition becomes tautological, at least for mechanics. The 
real content of Einstein’s first “principle” is therefore the 
assertion that the other laws of physics (e.g., the laws of 
electrodynamics) in homogeneous and isotropic form hold good in 
precisely the same set of coordinate systems in terms of which the 
laws of mechanics hold good. This is also the empirical content of 
the failure of the attempts to detect the Earth’s absolute motion 
through the electromagnetic ether. Thus Einstein’s first principle 
simply re-asserts Galileo’s claim that all effects of uniform 
rectilinear motion on the laws of physics can be “transformed 
away” by a suitable choice of coordinate systems.
 

The second principle, too, applies only to a (local) inertia-based 
coordinate system, and only in vacuum, and Einstein chose to 
express it in terms of just one such system, which his readers 
would have identified with the rest frame of Lorentz’s ether, even 
though Einstein is stipulating a vacuum and excluding any 
efficacious ether. Skeptics sometimes suspect that this light-
speed principle is circular, because (as noted above) Einstein 
used light signals to establish the coordinates, so the second 
principle states that the speed of light is c in terms of 
coordinates defined such that the speed of light is c. It would 
have been more clear (as he later acknowledged) to use mechanical 
inertia to establish simultaneity of inertial coordinate systems 
by (for example) using two identical and mutually repulsive 
particles released from rest at the midpoint between two clocks. 
Equivalently we could use sound waves from the midpoint of a solid 
rod to synchronize clocks at the ends. This makes it clear that 
the physical content of the second principle is that the 
propagation speed of light is isotropic in terms of the same 
coordinates in which mechanical inertia is isotropic.
 

This second principle was ostensibly based on all the experimental 
results that are consistent with the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for 
the ether frame. Combining this principle with the first, along 
with the tacit premise that the vacuum does not discriminate 
between different states of motion, Einstein immediately infers 
that the speed of light is invariant with respect to every system 
of inertial coordinates. This extension is based on the unspoken 
and non-trivial premise about the vacuum, so later authors have 
often simply taken the general proposition as the second 
principle. (See Section 3.1 for more discussion of the foundations 
of Einstein’s principles.) Of course, Einstein’s weaker form of 
the second principle has significant content, since we are not 
guaranteed that the speed of every pulse of light is isotropic and 
homogeneous in terms of any (let alone every) system of inertial 
coordinates. For example, it would not be in a classical emission 
theory.

 
After stating his two principles, Einstein goes on to derive the 
relationship (now called the Lorentz transformation) between 
inertia-based coordinate systems. The actual detailed derivation 
presented in Einstein’s 1905 paper appears somewhat circuitous and 
overly elaborate today, but it’s worthwhile to follow his 
reasoning, partly for historical interest, and partly to contrast 
it with the more direct and compelling derivations presented in 
subsequent sections.


Following Einstein’s original derivation, we begin with an 
inertial (and Cartesian) coordinate system called K, with the 
coordinates x, y, z, t, and we posit another system of inertial 
coordinates denoted as k, with the coordinates ξ, η, ζ, τ. The 
spatial axes of these two systems are aligned, and the spatial 
origin of k is moving in the positive x direction with speed v in 
terms of K. We then consider a particle at rest in the k system, 
and note that for such a particle the x and t coordinates (i.e., 
the coordinates in terms of the K system) are related by xʹ = x − 
vt for some constant xʹ. We also know the y and z coordinates of 
such a particle are constant. Hence each stationary spatial 
position in the k system corresponds to a set of three constants 
(xʹ,y,z), and we can also assign the time coordinate t to each 
event.
 

Interestingly, the system of variables xʹ,y,z,t constitute a 
complete coordinate system, related to the original system K by a 
Galilean transformation xʹ = x − vt, yʹ=y, zʹ=z, tʹ=t. Thus, just 
as Lorentz did in 1892, Einstein began by essentially applying a 
Galilean transformation to the original “rest frame” coordinates 
to give an intermediate system of coordinates, although Einstein’s 
paper makes it clear that this is not an inertial coordinate 
system.


Now we consider the values of the τ coordinate of the k system as 
a function of xʹ,y,z,t for any stationary point in the k system. 
Suppose a pulse of light is emitted from the origin of the k 
system in the positive x direction at time τ0, it reaches the 
point corresponding to xʹ,y,z at time τ1, where it is reflected, 
arriving back at the origin of the k system at time τ2. This is 
depicted in the figure below.

Recall that the ξ, η, ζ, τ coordinates are defined as inertial 
coordinates, meaning that inertia is homogeneous and isotropic in 
terms of these coordinates. Also, all experimental evidence (such 
as all "the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the 
earth relatively to the 'light medium'") indicates that the speed 
of light is isotropic in terms of any inertial coordinate system. 
Therefore, we have t1 = (t0 + t2)/2, so the τ coordinate as a 
function of xʹ,y,z,t satisfies the relation

$
tau vec(x',0,0, t_0 + x'/(c-v)) = 1/2
( vec(0,0,0, t_0) + 
tau vec(0, 0, 0, t_0 + x'/(c-v) + x'/(c+v)  ))
