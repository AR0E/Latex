== Inertia and Relativity <IneAndRelativity>

#blockquote[
These or none must serve for reasons, and it is my great happiness that 
examples prove not rules, for to confirm this opinion, the world yields 
not one example.

  --- John Donne

In his treatise _"On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres"_, 
Copernicus argued for the conceivability of a moving Earth by 
noting that

#blockquote[
  ...every apparent change in place occurs on account of the movement 
  either of the thing seen or of the spectator, or on account of the 
  necessarily unequal movement of both. No movement is perceptible 
  relatively to things moved equally in the same direction - I mean 
  relatively to the thing seen and the spectator... As the ship floats 
  along the calm, all external things seem to have the motion that is 
  really that of the ship, while those within the ship feel that they 
  and all its contents are at rest....
]

The first part of this quote suggests a purely _kinematical_ and 
_relational_ conception of relativity (like that of Aristarchus), based 
simply on the idea that we judge the positions of objects only in 
relation to other objects. However, the “thought experiment” involving a 
ship floating “along the calm” hints at a more sophisticated concept of 
relativity based on the _principle of inertia_, 
even though Copernicus was 
in no position to justify this analogy with a theory of dynamics. Hence 
the hypothesis of a moving Earth was vulnerable to the objection that we 
do not directly “sense” any such motion. Partly to answer this 
objection, Galileo began the development of the modern concept of 
inertia, on the basis of which Copernicus’s claim about the behavior of 
objects inside a ship moving at some constant speed in a straight line 
can be justified. Galileo pointed out that

#blockquote[
  ... among things which all share equally in any motion, [that motion] 
  does not act, and is as if it did not exist... in throwing something 
  to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one direction 
  than in another, the distances being equal... jumping with your feet 
  together, you pass equal spaces in every direction...
]

Thus Galileo's approach was based on a dynamical rather than a merely 
kinematic analysis, because he refers to forces acting on bodies, 
asserting that the dynamic behavior of bodies is homogeneous and 
isotropic in terms of (suitably defined) measures in any uniform state 
of motion. This soon led to the modern principle of inertial relativity, 
although Galileo himself seems never to have fully grasped the 
distinction between accelerated and unaccelerated motion. He believed, 
for example, that circular motion was a natural state that would persist 
unless acted upon by some external agent. This shows that the resolution 
of dynamical behavior into inertial and non-inertial components – which 
we generally take for granted today – is more subtle than it may appear. 
As Newton wrote:

#blockquote[
  ...the whole burden of philosophy seems to consist in this: from the 
  phenomena of motions to infer the forces of nature, and then from 
  these forces to deduce other phenomena...
]


 

Newton’s doctrine implicitly assumes that forces can be inferred from 
the motions of objects, but establishing the correspondence between 
forces and motions is not trivial, because the doctrine is, in a sense, 
circular. We infer “the forces of nature” from observed motions, and 
then we account for observed motions in terms of those forces. This 
assumes we can distinguish between forced and unforced motion, but there 
is no a priori way of making such a distinction. For example, the 
roughly circular motion of the Moon around the Earth might suggest the 
existence of a force (universal gravitation) acting between these two 
bodies, but it could also be taken as an indication that circular motion 
is a natural form of unforced motion, as Galileo believed. Different 
definitions of unforced motion lead to different sets of implied “forces 
of nature”. 

The task is to choose a definition of unforced motion that 
leads to the identification of a set of physical forces that gives the 
most intelligible accounting of the phenomena. By indirect reasoning, 
the natural philosophers of the seventeenth century eventually arrived 
at the idea that, in the complete absence of external forces, an object 
would move uniformly in a straight line, and that, therefore, whenever 
we observe an object whose speed or direction of motion is changing, we 
can infer that an external force – proportional to the rate of change of 
motion – is acting upon that object. This is the principle of inertia, 
the most successful principle ever proposed for organizing our knowledge 
of the natural world. Notice that it refers to how a free object “would” 
move, because no object in our experience is completely free from all 
external forces. 

Thus the conditions of this fundamental principle, as 
stated, are never actually met, which highlights the subtlety of 
Newton’s doctrine, and the aptness of his assertion that it comprises “the 
whole burden of philosophy”. Also, notice that the principle of inertia 
does not discriminate between different states of uniform motion in 
straight lines, so it automatically entails a principle of relativity of 
dynamics, and in fact the two are essentially synonymous.

One of the first explicit statements of the modern principle of inertial 
relativity was made by _Pierre Gassendi_, who is most 
often remembered today 
for reviving the ancient Greek doctrine of atomism. In the 1630's Gassendi 
repeated many of Galileo's experiments with motion, and interpreted them 
from a more abstract point of view, consciously separating out gravity as 
an external influence, and recognizing that the remaining "natural states 
of motions" were characterized not only by uniform speeds (as Galileo had 
said) but also by _rectilinear paths._ In order to conceive of inertial 
motion, it is necessary to review the whole range of observable motions of 
material objects and imagine those motions if the effects of all known 
external influences were removed. From this resulting set of ideal states 
of motion, it is necessary to identify the largest possible "equivalence 
class" of relatively uniform and rectilinear motions. These motions and 
configurations then constitute the basis for inertial measurements of 
space and time, i.e., inertial coordinate systems. Naturally inertial 
motions will then necessarily be uniform and rectilinear with respect to 
these coordinate systems, by definition.

Shortly thereafter (1644), Descartes presented the concept of 
inertial motion in his _"Principles of Philosophy"_: 

#blockquote[
  Each thing...continues always in the same state, and that which is once 
  moved always continues to move...and never changes unless caused by an 
  external agent... all motion is of itself in a straight line...every 
  part of a body, left to itself, continues to move, never in a curved 
  line, but only along a straight line.
]

Similarly, in Huygens' _"The Motion of Colliding Bodies"_ 
(composed in the mid 1650's but not published until 1703), 
the first hypothesis was that

#blockquote[
  Any body already in motion will continue to move perpetually with the 
  same speed in a straight line unless it is impeded
]

Ultimately Newton incorporated this principle into his masterpiece, 
_"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"_ (The Mathematical 
Principles of Natural Philosophy), as the first of his three “laws of 
motion":

1. Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by the forces  impressed upon it.

2. The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.

3. To every action there is always opposed an equal and opposite reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.

These “laws” express the classical mechanical principle of relativity, 
asserting equivalence between the conditions of "rest" and "uniform 
motion in a right line". Since no distinction is made between the 
various possible directions of uniform motion, the principle also 
implies the equivalence of uniform motion in all directions in space. 
Thus, if everything in the universe is a "body" in the sense of this 
law, and if we stipulate rules of force (such as Newton's second and 
third laws) that likewise do not distinguish between bodies at rest and 
bodies in uniform motion, then we arrive at a complete system of 
dynamics in which, as Newton said, "absolute rest cannot be determined 
from the positions of bodies in our regions". Corollary 5 of Newton’s 
Principia states 

#blockquote[
  The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among 
  themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forwards 
  in a straight line without circular motion.
]

Of course, this presupposes that the words "uniformly" and "straight" 
have unambiguous meanings. Our concepts of uniform speed and straight 
paths are ultimately _derived_ from observations of inertial motions, so 
the “laws of motion” are to some extent circular. These laws were 
historically expressed in terms of inertial coordinate systems, which in 
turn are defined by the laws of motion. In other words, we define an 
inertial coordinate system as a system of space and time coordinates in 
terms of which inertia is homogeneous and isotropic, and then we 
announce the “laws of motion”, which assert that inertia is homogeneous 
and isotropic with respect to inertial coordinate systems. Thus the 
“laws of motion” are true by definition. Their significance lies not in 
their truth, which is trivial, but in their applicability. The empirical 
fact that there exist systems of inertial coordinates is what makes the 
concept significant. 

We have no _a priori_ reason to expect that such 
coordinate systems exist, i.e., that the forces of nature would resolve 
themselves so coherently on this (or any other finite) basis, but they 
evidently do. In fact, it appears that not just one such coordinate 
system exists (which would be remarkable enough), but that infinitely 
many of them exist, in all possible states of relative motion. To be 
precise, the principle of relativity asserts that for any material 
particle in any state of motion there exists an inertial coordinate 
system in terms of which the particle is (at least momentarily) at rest.

It’s important to recognize that Newton’s first law, by itself, is not 
sufficient to identify the systems of coordinates in terms of which all 
three laws of motion are satisfied. The first law serves to determine 
the shape of the coordinate axes and inertial paths, but it does not 
fully define a system of inertial coordinates, because the first law is 
satisfied in infinitely many systems of coordinates that are _not_ 
inertial coordinates in the sense defined above. The system of oblique 
$(x,t)$ coordinates illustrated below is an example of such a system.

)


The two dashed lines indicate the paths of two identical objects, both 
initially at rest with respect to these coordinates and propelled o
utward from the origin by impulses of equal magnitude (acting against 
each other). Every object not subject to external forces moves with 
uniform speed in a straight line with respect to this coordinate system, 
so Newton's First Law of motion is satisfied, but the second law clearly 
is not, because the speeds imparted to these identical objects by equal 
forces are not equal. In other words, inertia is not isotropic with 
respect to these coordinates. In order for Newton's Second Law to be 
satisfied, we not only need the coordinate axes to be straight and 
uniformly graduated relative to freely moving objects, we need the space 
axes to be aligned in time such that mechanical inertia is the same in 
all spatial directions (so that, for example, the objects whose paths 
are represented by the two dashed lines in the above figure have the 
same speeds). 

This effectively establishes the _planes of simultaneity_ of 
inertial coordinate systems. In an operational sense, Newton's Third Law 
is also involved in establishing the planes of simultaneity for an 
inertial coordinate system, because it is only by means of the Third Law 
that we can actually define "equal forces" as the forces necessary to 
impart equal "quantities of motion" (to use Newton’s phrase). Of course, 
this doesn't imply that inertial coordinate systems are the "true" 
systems of reference. They are simply the most intuitive, convenient, 
and readily accessible systems, based on the inertial behavior of 
material objects.

In addition to contributing to the definition of an inertial coordinate 
system, the third law also serves to establish a fundamental aspect of 
the relationships between relatively moving inertial coordinate systems. 
Specifically, the third law implies (requires) that if the spatial 
origin of one inertial coordinate system is moving at velocity v with 
respect to a second inertial coordinate system, then the spatial origin 
of the second system is moving at velocity -v with respect to the first. 
This property is sometimes called reciprocity, and is important for the 
various derivations of the Lorentz transformation to be presented in 
subsequent sections.

Based on the definition of an inertial coordinate system, and the 
isotropy of inertia with respect to such coordinates, it follows that 
two identical objects, initially at rest with respect to those 
coordinates and exerting a mutual force on each other, recoil by equal 
distances in equal times (in accord with Newton’s third law). Assuming 
the lengths of stable material objects are independent of their spatial 
positions and orientations (spatial homogeneity and isotropy), it 
follows that we can synchronize distant clocks with identical particles 
ejected with equal forces from the mid-point between the clocks. This 
operational definition of simultaneity is not new. It is precisely what 
Galileo described in his illustration of inertial motion onboard a 
moving ship. When he wrote that an object thrown with equal force will 
reach equal distances [in the same time], he was implicitly defining 
simultaneity at separate locations on the basis of inertial isotropy. 
This is crucial to understanding the significance of inertial coordinate 
systems. 

The requirement for a particular object to be at rest with 
respect to the system suffices only to determine the direction of the 
"time axis", i.e., the loci of constant spatial position. Galileo and 
his successors realized (although they did not always explicitly state) 
that it is also necessary to specify the loci of constant temporal 
position, and this is achieved by choosing coordinates in such a way 
that mechanical inertia is isotropic. (This means the inertia of an 
object does not depend on any absolute reference direction in space, 
although it may depend on the velocity of the object. It is sufficient 
to say the resistance to acceleration of a resting object is the same in 
all spatial directions.)

Conceptually, to establish a complete system of space and time 
coordinates based on inertial isotropy, imagine that at each point in 
space there is an identically constructed cannon, and all these cannons 
are at rest with respect to each other. At one particular point, which 
we designate as the origin of our coordinates, is a clock and numerous 
identical cannons, each pointed at one of the other cannons out in 
space. The cannons are fired from the origin, and when a cannonball 
passes one of the external cannons it triggers that external cannon to 
fire a reply back to the origin. Each cannonball has identifying marks 
so we can correlate each reply with the shot that triggered it, and with 
the identity of the replying cannon. 
The $i-$th reply event is assigned the 
time coordinate

$
t_i = (t_"return" (i) - t_"send" (i))/2 "(seconds)"
$

And it is 
assigned space coordinates $x_i, y_i, z_i$ 
based on the angular direction of 
the sending cannon and the radial distance $r_i = t_i$ 
cannon-seconds. This 
procedure would have been perfectly intelligible to Newton, and he would 
have agreed that it yields an inertial coordinate system, suitable for 
the application of his three laws of motion. 

Naturally given one such system of coordinates, we can construct 
infinitely many others by simple spatial re-orientation of the space 
axes and/or translation of the spatial or temporal axes. All such 
transformations leave the speed of every object unchanged. An 
equivalence class of all such inertial coordinate systems is called an 
_*inertial reference frame.*_ 
For characterizing the mutual dynamical states 
of two material bodies, the associated inertial rest frames of the 
bodies are more meaningful than the mere distance between the bodies, 
because any inertial coordinate system possesses a fixed spatial 
_orientation_ with respect to any other, enabling us to take account of 
tangential motion between bodies whose mutual distance is not changing. 
For this reason, the physically meaningful "relative velocity of two 
material bodies" is best defined as their reciprocal states of motion 
with respect to each others' associated inertial rest frame coordinates.


The principle of relativity does not tell us how two relatively moving 
systems of inertial coordinates are related to each other, but it does 
imply that this relationship can be determined empirically. We need only 
construct two relatively moving systems of inertial coordinates and 
compare them. Based on observations of coordinate systems with 
relatively low mutual speeds, and with the limited precision available 
at the time, Galileo and Newton surmised that if $(x,t)$ is an inertial 
coordinate system then so is $(x',t')$, where

$
x' = x - v t, quad t' = t
$

and $v$ is the mutual speed between the origins of the two systems. This 
implies that relative speeds are simply additive. In other words, if a 
material object $B$ is moving at the speed $v$ in terms of inertial rest 
frame coordinates of $A$, and if an object $C$ is moving in the same 
direction at the speed $u$ in terms of inertial rest frame coordinates of 
$B$, then $C$ is moving at the speed $v + u$ in terms of inertial rest frame 
coordinates of $A$. This conclusion may seem plausible, but it's important 
to realize that we are not free to arbitrarily adopt this or any other 
transformation and speed composition rule for the set of inertial 
coordinate systems, because those systems are already fully defined (up 
to conventional scale factors) by the requirements for inertia to be 
homogeneous and isotropic and for momentum to be conserved. These 
properties suffice to determine the set of inertial coordinate systems 
_and_ (therefore) the relationships between them. Given these conditions, 
the relationship between relatively moving inertial coordinate systems, 
whatever it may be, is a matter of empirical fact.


Of course, inertial isotropy is not the only possible basis for 
constructing spacetime coordinate systems. We could impose a different 
constraint to determine the loci of constant temporal position, such as 
a total temporal ordering of events. However, if we do this, we will 
find that mechanical inertia is generally not isotropic in terms of the 
resulting coordinate systems, so the usual symmetrical laws of mechanics 
will not be valid in terms of those coordinate systems (at least not if 
restricted to ponderable matter).  Indeed this was the case for the 
ether theories developed in the late 19th century, as discussed in 
subsequent sections. Such coordinate systems, while extremely awkward, 
would not be logically inconsistent. The choices we make to specify a 
coordinate system and to resolve spacetime intervals into separate 
spatial and temporal components are to some extent conventional, 
provided we are willing to disregard the manifest symmetry of physical 
phenomena. But since physics consists of identifying and understanding 
the symmetries of nature, the option of disregarding those symmetries 
does not appeal to most physicists.


By the end of the nineteenth century a new class of phenomena involving 
electric and magnetic fields had been incorporated into physics, and the 
concept of inertia was found to be applicable to these phenomena as 
well. For example, Maxwell’s equations imply that a pulse of light 
conveys momentum. Hence the principle of inertia ought to apply to 
electromagnetism as well as to the motions of material bodies. In his 
1905 paper _“On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”_, Einstein adopted 
this more comprehensive interpretation of inertia, basing the special 
theory of relativity on the proposition that

#blockquote[
The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo changes are not 
affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the 
other of two systems of [inertial] coordinates in uniform translatory 
motion.
]

This is nearly identical to Newton’s Corollary 5. It’s unfortunate that 
the word "inertial" was omitted, because, as noted above, uniform 
translatory motion is not sufficient to ensure that a system of 
coordinates is actually an inertial coordinate system in the full sense. 
However, Einstein made it clear that he was indeed talking about 
inertial coordinate systems when he previously characterized them as 
coordinate systems “in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold 
good”. Admittedly this is a somewhat awkward assertion in the context of 
Einstein’s paper, because one of the main conclusions of the paper is 
that the equations of Newtonian mechanics do not precisely “hold good” 
with respect to inertial coordinate systems. Recognizing this 
inconsistency, Sommerfeld added a footnote in subsequent published 
editions of Einstein’s paper, qualifying the statement about Newtonian 
mechanics holding good “to the first approximation”, but this footnote 
does not really clarify the situation. 

Fundamentally, the class of 
coordinate systems that Einstein was trying to identify (the inertial 
coordinate systems) are those in terms of which inertia is homogeneous 
and isotropic, meaning that free objects move at constant speed in 
straight lines and (just as importantly) the force required to 
accelerate an object from rest to a given speed is the same in all 
directions. As discussed above, these conditions are just sufficient to 
determine a coordinate system in terms of which the symmetrical 
equations of mechanics hold good, but without pre-supposing the exact 
form of those equations.

Since light (i.e., an electromagnetic wave) carries momentum, and the 
procedure for constructing an inertial coordinate system described 
previously was based on the isotropy of momentum, it is reasonable to 
expect that pulses of light could be used in place of cannonballs, and 
we should arrive at essentially the same class of coordinate systems. In his 1905 paper this is how Einstein described the construction of 
inertial coordinate systems, tacitly asserting that the propagation of 
light is isotropic with respect to the same class of coordinate systems 
in terms of which mechanical inertia is isotropic. In this respect it 
might seem as if he was treating light as a stream of inertial 
particles, and indeed his paper on special relativity was written just 
after the paper in which he introduced the concept of photons. However, 
we know that light is not exactly like a stream of material particles, 
especially because we cannot conceive of light being at rest with 
respect to any system of inertial coordinates. The way in which light 
fits into the framework of inertial coordinate systems is considered in 
the next section. We will find that although the principle of relativity 
continues to apply, and the definition of inertial coordinate systems 
remains unchanged, the relationship between relatively moving systems of 
inertial coordinate systems must be different than what Galileo and 
Newton surmised.
