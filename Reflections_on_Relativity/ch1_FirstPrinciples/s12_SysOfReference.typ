There are many theories of relativity, each of which can be associated with some 
arbitrariness in our descriptions of events. For example, suppose we describe the 
spatial relations between stationary particles on a line by assigning a real-
valued coordinate to each particle, such that the distance between any two 
particles equals the difference between their coordinates. 

There is a degree of 
arbitrariness in this description due to the fact that all the coordinates could 
be increased by some arbitrary constant without affecting any of the relations 
between the particles. Symbolically this translational relativity can be expressed 
by saying that if x is a suitable system of coordinates for describing the 
relations between the particles, then so is $x + k$ for any constant $k$. 

Likewise if 
we describe the spatial relations between stationary particles on a plane by 
assigning an ordered pair of real-valued coordinates to each particle, such that 
the squared distance between any two particles equals the sum of the squares of 
the differences between their respective coordinates, then there is a degree of 
arbitrariness in the description (in addition to the translational relativity of 
each individual coordinate) due to the fact that we could rotate the coordinates 
of every particle by an arbitrary constant angle without affecting any of the 
relations between the particles. This relativity of orientation is expressed 
symbolically by saying that if $(x,y)$ is a suitable system of coordinates for 
describing the positions of particles on a plane, then so is 
$(a x-b y, b x+a y)$ where  $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.

These relativities are purely formal, in the sense that they are tautological 
consequences of the premises, regardless of whether they have any physical 
applicability. Our first premise was that it’s possible to assign a single real-
valued coordinate to each particle on a line such that the distance between any 
two particles equals the difference between their coordinates. If this premise is 
satisfied, the invariance of relations under coordinate transformations from x to 
$x + k$ follows trivially, but if the pairwise distances between three given 
particles were, say, $5$, $3$, and $12$ units, 
then no three numbers could be assigned 
to the particles such that the pairwise differences equal the distances. 

This 
shows that the $n(n–1) slash 2$ pairwise distances between n particles cannot be 
independent of each other if those distances can be encoded unambiguously by just 
$n$ coordinates in one dimension or, more generally, by $k n$ coordinates in $k$ 
dimensions. A suitable system of coordinates in one dimension exists only if the 
distances between particles satisfy a very restrictive condition. Letting 
$d(A,B)$ denote the signed distance from $A$ to $B$, the 
condition that must be satisfiedis that for every three particles 
$A,B,C$ we have:

$
d(A,B) + d(B,C) + d(C,A) = 0. 
$

Of 
course, this is essentially the definition of _co-linearity_, but we have no a 
priori reason to expect this definition to have any applicability in the world of 
physical objects. The fact that it _has_ wide applicability is a 
_non-trivial_ aspect 
of our experience, albeit one that we ordinarily take for granted. 

Likewise for particles in a region of three dimensional space the premise that we 
can assign three numbers to each particle such that the squared distance between 
any two particles equals the sum of the squares of the differences between their 
respective coordinates is true only under a very restrictive condition, because 
there are only $3n$ degrees of freedom in the 
$n(n–1) slash 2$ pairwise distances between $n$ particles.


Just as we found _relativity of orientation_ for the pair of spatial coordinates 
$x$ 
and $y$, we also find the same relativity for each of the pairs $(x,z)$
and $(y,z)$ in three 
dimensional space. Thus we have _*translational relativity*_ for each of the four 
coordinates $(x,y,z,t)$, and we _*have rotational relativity*_ for each pair of spatial 
coordinates $(x,y), (x,z),$ and $(y,z)$. 

This leaves the pairs of coordinates $(x,t), 
(y,t)$ and $(z,t)$. Not surprisingly we find that there is an analogous arbitrariness 
in these coordinate pairs, which can be expressed (for the $(x,t$) pair) by saying 
that the relations between the instances of particles on a line as a function of 
time are unaffected if we replace the $x$ and $t$ coordinates with 
$(a x – b t)$ and $(–b x + a t)$ respectively, where $a^2 – b^2 = $1. 
These transformations (rotations in the $(x,t)$ 
plane through an _imaginary angle_), which characterize the theory of special 
relativity, are based on the premise that it is possible to assign pairs of 
values, $x$ and $t$, to each instance of each particle on the $x$ axis 
such that the 
squared spacetime distance equals the difference between the squares of the 
differences between the respective coordinates.

 
Each of the above examples represents an invariance of physically measurable 
relations under certain classes of linear transformations. Extending this idea, 
Einstein’s general theory of relativity shows how the laws of physics, suitably 
formulated, are invariant under an even larger class of transformations of space 
and time coordinates, including non-linear transformations, and how these 
transformations subsume the phenomena of gravity. In general relativity the 
metrical properties of space and time are not constant, so the simple premises on 
which we based the primitive relativities described above turn out not to be 
satisfied globally. However, it remains true that those simple premises are 
satisfied locally, i.e., over sufficiently small regions of space and time, so 
they continue to be of fundamental importance.

 

As mentioned previously, the relativities described above are purely formal and 
tautological, but it turns out that each of them is closely related to a non-
trivial physical symmetry. There exists a large class of identifiable objects 
whose lengths maintain a fixed proportion to each other under the very same set 
of transformations that characterize the relativities of the coordinates. In 
other words, just as we can translate the coordinates on the $x$ axis without 
affecting the length of any object, we also find a large class of objects that 
can be individually translated along the $x$ axis without affecting their lengths. 
The same applies to rotations and boosts. Such changes are physically distinct 
from purely formal shifts of the entire coordinate system, because when we move 
individual objects we are actually changing the relations between objects, since 
we are moving only a subset of all the coordinated objects. (Also, moving an 
object from one stationary position to another requires acceleration.) Thus for 
each formal arbitrariness in the system of coordinates there exists a physical 
symmetry, i.e., a large class of entities whose extents remain in constant 
proportions to each other when subjected individually to the same transformations.

 

We refer to these relations as physical symmetries rather than physical 
invariances, because (for example) we have no basis for asserting that the length 
of a solid object or the duration of a physical process is invariant under 
changes in position, orientation or state of motion. We have no way of assessing 
the truth of such a statement, because our measures of length and duration are 
all comparative. We can say only that the spatial and temporal extents of all the 
“stable” physical entities and processes are affected (if at all) in exactly the 
same proportion by changes in position, orientation, and state of motion. Of 
course, given this empirical fact, it is often convenient to speak as if the 
spatial and temporal extents are invariant, but we shouldn’t forget that, from an 
epistemological standpoint, we can assert only symmetry, not invariance.

In his original presentation of special relativity in 1905 Einstein took 
measuring rods and clocks as primitive elements, even though he realized the 
weakness of this approach. He later wrote of the special theory

#blockquote[
It is striking that the theory introduces two kinds of physical things, i.e., (1) 
measuring rods and clocks, and (2) all other things, e.g., the electromagnetic 
field, the material point, etc. This, in a certain sense, is inconsistent; 
strictly speaking, measuring rods and clocks should emerge as solutions of the 
basic equations (objects consisting of moving atomic configurations), not, as it 
were, as theoretically self-sufficient entities. The procedure was justified, 
however, because it was clear from the very beginning that the postulates of the 
theory are not strong enough to deduce from them equations for physical events 
sufficiently complete and sufficiently free from arbitrariness to form the basis 
of a theory of measuring rods and clocks.
]

This is quite similar to the view he expressed many years earlier

#blockquote[
  …the solid body and the clock do not in the conceptual edifice of physics play 
  the part of irreducible elements, but that of composite structures, which may 
  not play any independent part in theoretical physics. But it is my conviction 
  that in the present stage of development of theoretical physics these ideas 
  must still be employed as independent ideas; for we are still far from 
  possessing such certain knowledge of theoretical principles as to be able to 
  give exact theoretical constructions of solid bodies and clocks.

The first quote is from his Autobiographical Notes in 1949, whereas the second is 
from his essay on Geometry and Experience published in 1921. It’s interesting how 
little his views had changed during the intervening 28 years, despite the fact 
that those years saw the advent of quantum mechanics, which many would say 
provided the very theoretical principles underlying the construction of solid 
bodies and clocks that Einstein felt had been lacking. Whether or not the 
principles of quantum mechanics are adequate to justify our conceptions of 
reference lengths and time intervals, the characteristic spatial and temporal 
extents of quantum phenomena are used today as the basis for all such references.

 

Considering the arbitrariness of absolute coordinates, one might think our spatio-
temporal descriptions could be better expressed in purely relational terms, such 
as by specifying only the mutual distances (minimum path lengths) between 
objects. Nevertheless, the most common method of description is to assign 
absolute coordinates (three spatial and one temporal) to each object, with 
reference to an established system of coordinates, while recognizing that the 
choice of coordinate systems is to some extent arbitrary. The relations between 
objects are then inferred from these absolute (thought somewhat arbitrary) 
coordinates. This may seem to be a round-about process, but there are several 
reasons for using absolute coordinate systems to encode the relations between 
objects, rather than explicitly specifying the relations themselves.

 

One reason is that this approach enables us to take advantage of the efficiency 
made possible by the finite dimensionality of space. As discussed in 
@ExpToSpac, 
if there were no limit to the dimensionality of space, then we would expect a set 
of $n$ particles to have $n(n–1) slash 2$ independent pairwise spatial relations, so to 
explicitly specify all the distances between particles would require $n–1$ numbers 
for each particle, representing the distances to each of the other particles. For 
a large number of particles (to say nothing of a potentially infinite number) 
this would be impractical. Fortunately the spatial relations between the objects 
of our experience are not mutually independent. The nth particle essentially adds 
only three (rather than $n–1$) degrees of freedom to the relational configuration. 
In physical terms this restriction can be clearly seen from the fact that the 
maximum number of mutually equidistant particles in $d$-dimensional space is 
$d+1$. 
Experience teaches us that in our physical space we can arrange four, but not 
five or more, particles such that they are all mutually equidistant, so we 
conclude that our space has three dimensions.

 

Historically the use of absolute coordinates rather than explicit relations may 
also have been partly due to the fact that analytic geometry and Cartesian 
coordinates were invented (by Fermat, Descartes and others) at almost the same 
time that the new science of mechanics needed them, just as tensor analysis was 
invented, three hundred years later, at the very moment when it was needed to 
facilitate the development of general relativity. (Of course, such coincidences 
are not accidental; contrivances requiring new materials tend to be invented soon 
after the material becomes available.) The coordinate systems of Descartes were 
not merely efficient, they were also consistent with the ancient Aristotelian 
belief (also held by Descartes) that there is no such thing as empty space or 
vacuum, and that continuous substance permeates the universe. In this context we 
cannot even contemplate explicitly specifying each individual distance between 
substantial points, because space is regarded as a continuum of substance. For 
Aristotle and Descartes, every spatial extent is a measure of the length of some 
substance, not a pure distance between particles as contemplated by atomists. In 
this sense we can say that the continuous absolute coordinate systems inherited 
by modern science from Aristotle and Descartes are a remnant of the Cartesian 
natural philosophy.

 

Another, perhaps more compelling, reason for the adoption of abstract coordinate 
systems in the descriptions of physical phenomena was the need to account for 
acceleration. As Newton explained with the example of a “spinning pail”, the 
mutual relations between a set of material particles in an instant are not 
adequate to fully characterize a physical situation – at least not if we are 
considering only a small subset of all the particles in the universe. (Whether 
the mutual relations would be adequate if all the matter in the universe was 
taken into account is an open question.) In retrospect, there were other possible 
alternatives, such as characterizing not just the relations between particles at 
a specific instant, but over some temporal span of existence, but this would have 
required the unification of spatial and temporal measures, which did not occur 
until much later. Originally the motions of objects were represented simply by 
allowing the spatial coordinates of each persistent object to be continuous 
single-valued functions of one real variable, the time coordinate.

 

Incidentally, one consequence of the use of absolute coordinates is that it 
automatically entails a breaking of the alleged translational symmetry. We said 
previously that the coordinate system x could be replaced by $x + k$ for any real 
number $k$, implying that every real value of $k$ is in some sense equally suitable. 
However, from a strictly mathematical point of view there does not exist a 
uniform distribution over the real numbers, so this form of representation does 
not exactly entail the perfect symmetry of position in an infinite space, even if 
the space is completely empty.

 

The set of all combinations of values for the three spatial coordinates and one 
time coordinate is assumed to give a complete coordination not only of the 
spatial positions of each entity at each time, but of all possible spatial 
positions at all possible times. Any definite set of space and time coordinates 
constitutes a system of reference. There are infinitely many distinct ways in 
which such coordinates can be assigned, but they are not entirely arbitrary, 
because we limit the range of possibilities by requiring contiguous physical 
entities to be assigned contiguous coordinates. This imposes a definite structure 
on the system, so it is more than merely a set of labels; it represents the most 
primitive laws of physics.

 

One way of specifying an entire model of a world consisting of $n$ (classical) 
particles would be to explicitly give the 3n functions $x_j (t), y_j (t), 
z_j (t)$ for $j = 1 dots n$. In this form, the un-occupied points of space would be irrelevant, 
since only the actual paths of actual physical entities have any meaning. In 
fact, it could be argued that only the intersections of these particles have 
physical significance, so the paths followed by the particles in between their 
mutual intersections could be regarded as merely hypothetical. Following this 
approach we might end up with a purely combinatorial specification of discrete 
interactions, with no need for the notion of a continuous physical space within 
which entities reside and move. However, the hypothesis that physical objects 
have continuous positions as functions of time with respect to a specified system 
of reference has proven to be extremely useful, especially for purposes of 
describing simple laws by which the observable interactions can be efficiently 
described and predicted.

 

An important class of physical laws that make use of the full spatio-temporal 
framework consists of laws that are expressed in terms of fields. A field is 
regarded as existing at each point within the system of coordinates, even those 
points that are not occupied by a material particle. Therefore, each continuous 
field existing throughout time has, potentially, far more degrees of freedom than 
does a discrete particle, or even infinitely many discrete particles. Arguably, 
we never actually observe fields, were merely observe effects attributed to 
fields. It’s ironic that we can simplify the descriptions of particles by 
introducing hypothetical entities (fields) with far more degrees of freedom, but 
the laws governing the behavior of these fields (e.g., Maxwell’s equations for 
the electromagnetic field) along with symmetries and simple boundary conditions 
suffice to constrain the fields so that actually do provide a simplification. 
(Fields also provide a way of maintaining conservation laws for interactions “at 
a distance”.) Whether the usefulness of the concepts of continuous space, time, 
and fields suggests that they possess some ontological status is debatable, but 
the concepts are undeniably useful.

 

These systems of reference are more than simple labeling. The numerical values of 
the coordinates are intended to connote physical properties of order and measure. 
In fact, we might even suppose that the sequence of states of all particles are 
uniformly parameterized by the time coordinate of our system of reference, but 
therein lies an ambiguity, because it isn't clear how the temporal states of one 
particle are to be placed in correspondence with the temporal states of another. 
Here we must make an important decision about how our model of the world is to be 
constructed. We might choose to regard the totality of all entities as comprising 
a single element in a succession of universal temporal states, in which case the 
temporal correspondence between entities is unambiguous. In such a universe the 
temporal coordinate induces a total ordering of events, which is to say, if we 
let the symbol  ≤  denote temporal precedence or equality, then for every three 
events $a,b,c$ we have

$
&1) space a<=a \
&2) "if" a<=b "and" b<=a, " then" a=b \
&3) "if" a<=b "and" b<=c, " then" a<=c \
&4) "either" a<=b "or" b<a
$

However, this is not the only possible choice. We might choose instead to regard 
the temporal state of each individual particle as an independent quantity, 
bearing in mind that orderings of the elements of a set are not necessarily 
total. For example, consider the subsets of a flat plane, and the ordering 
induced by the inclusion relation $subset.eq$. Obviously the first three axioms of a total 
ordering are satisfied, because for any three subsets a,b,c of the plane we have 

$
&1) space a subset.eq a \
&2) "if" a subset.eq b "and" b subset.eq a, " then" a=b \
&3) "if" a subset.eq b "and" b subset.eq c, " then" a subset.eq c \
$

However, the fourth axiom is _not_ satisfied, because it's entirely 
possible to have two sets neither of which is included in the other. An ordering 
of this type is called a _partial ordering_, and we should allow for the 
possibility that the temporal relations between events induce a _partial_ rather 
than a _total_ ordering. In fact, we have no a priori reason to expect that 
temporal relations induce _even_ a partial ordering. It is safest to assume that 
each entity possesses its own temporal state, and let our observations teach us 
how those states are mutually related, if at all. (Similar caution should be 
applied when modeling the relations between the spatial states of particles.)

 
Given any system of space and time coordinates we can define infinitely many 
others such that speeds are preserved. This represents an equivalence relation, 
and we can then define a reference frame as an equivalence class of coordinate 
systems such that the speed of each object has the same value in terms of each 
coordinate system in that class. Thus within a reference frame we can speak of 
the speed of an object, without needing to specify any particular coordinate 
system. Of course, just as our coordinate systems are generally valid only 
locally, so too are the reference frames.


Purely kinematic relativity contains enough degrees of freedom that we can simply 
define our systems of reference (i.e., coordinate systems) to satisfy the 
additivity of velocity. In other words, we can adopt _velocity additivity as a 
principle,_ and this is essentially what scientists had tacitly done since ancient 
times. The great insight of Galileo and his successors was that this principle is 
inadequate to single out the physically meaningful reference systems. A new 
principle was necessary, namely, the _*principle of inertia*_, to be discussed in the 
next section.
