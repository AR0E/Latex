We ordinarily take for granted the existence through time of objects 
moving according to fixed laws in three-dimensional space, but this
is a highly abstract model of the objective world, far removed from 
the raw sense impressions that comprise our actual experience. This 
model may be consistent with our sense impressions, but it 
certainly 
is not uniquely determined by them. For example, Ptolemy and 
Copernicus constructed two very different conceptual models of the 
heavens based on essentially the same set of raw sense impressions. 
Likewise Weber 
#footnote[ The theory of velocity-dependant
force by Weber @weber1893werke is a curious instrument
in the discussion of self-forces, later mentioned.] and Maxwell synthesized two very different 
conceptual 
models of electromagnetism to account for a single set of observed 
phenomena. The fact that our raw sense impressions and experiences 
are (at least nominally) compatible with widely differing concepts 
of the world has led some philosophers to suggest that we should 
dispense with the idea of an "objective world" altogether
#footnote[Anti-realist notions are fairly important @ChallengesMetaphysicalRealism
when constructing the epistemic and _operational_ character of
physical theories.], and base 
our physical theories on nothing but direct sense impressions, all 
else being merely the products of our imaginations. 

Berkeley 
expressed the positivist identification of sense impressions with 
objective existence by the famous phrase _"esse est percipi"_ (_to be 
is to be perceived_). However, all attempts to base physical 
theories 
on nothing but raw sense impressions, avoiding arbitrary conceptual 
elements, invariably founder at the very start, because we have no 
sure means of distinguishing sense impressions from our thoughts 
and 
ideas. In fact, even the decision to make such a distinction 
represents a significant conceptual choice, one that is not 
strictly necessary on the basis of experience.


The process by which we, as individuals, learn to recognize sense impressions 
induced by an external world, and to distinguish them from our own internal 
thoughts and ideas, is highly complicated, and perhaps ultimately 
inexplicable. As Einstein put it (paraphrasing Kant) _“the eternal mystery of 
the world is its comprehensibility”_. Nevertheless, in order to examine the 
epistemological foundations of any physical theory, we must give some 
consideration to how the elements of the theory are actually derived from our 
raw sense impressions, without automatically interpreting them in conventional 
terms. On the other hand, if we suppress every pre-conceived notion, including 
ordinary rules of reasoning, we can hardly hope to make any progress. We must 
choose a level of abstraction deep enough to give a meaningful perspective, 
but not so deep that it can never be connected to conventional ideas.
 

As an example of a moderately abstract model of experience, we might represent 
an idealized observer as a linearly ordered sequence of states, each of which 
is a function of the preceding states and of a set of raw sense impressions 
from external sources. This already entails two profound choices. First, it is 
a purely passive model, in the sense that it does not invoke volition or free 
will. As a result, all conditional statements in this model must be 
interpreted only as correlations (as discussed more fully in section 3.2), 
because without freedom it is meaningless to talk about the different 
consequences of alternate hypothetical actions. Second, by stipulating that 
the states are functions of the preceding but not the subsequent states we 
introduce an inherent directional asymmetry to experience, even though the 
justification for this is far from clear.

 

Still another choice must be made as to whether the sequence of states and 
experiences is continuous or discrete. In either case we can parameterize the 
sequence by a variable $lambda$, and for the sake of definiteness we might represent 
each _state_ $S(lambda)$ and the corresponding _sense impressions_ $E(lambda)$ by strings of 
binary bits. Now, because of the mysterious comprehensibility of the world, it 
may happen that some functions of $S$ are correlated with some functions of $E$. 
(Since this is a passive model by assumption, we cannot assert anything more 
than statistical correlations, because we do not have the freedom to 
arbitrarily vary $S$ and determine the resulting $E$, but in principle we could 
still passively encounter enough variety of states and experiences to infer 
the most prominent correlations.)

)

These most primitive correlations are 
presumably “hard-wired” into higher-level categories of senses and concepts 
(i.e., state variables), rather than being  sorted out cognitively. In terms 
of these higher-level variables we might find that over some range of $lambda$ the 
sense impressions $E(lambda)$ are strictly correlated with three functions 
$(theta, phi, alpha)$ of 
the state $S(lambda)$, which change only incrementally from one state to the next. 
Also, we may find that $E$ is only incrementally different for incremental 
differences in $(theta, phi, alpha)$ (independent of the prior values of those functions), 
and that this is the smallest and simplest set of functions with this 
property. Finally, suppose the sense impressions corresponding to a given set 
of values of the state functions are identical if the values of those 
functions are increased or decreased by some constant.

This describes roughly how an abstract observer might infer an orientation 
space along with the associated modes of interaction. In conventional terms, 
the observer infers the existence of external objects which induce a 
particular set of sense impressions depending on the observer’s orientation. 
(Of course, this interpretation is necessarily conjectural; there may be 
other, perhaps more complex, interpretations that correspond as well or better 
with the observer’s actual sequence of experiences.) At some point the 
observer may begin to perceive deviations from the simple three-variable 
orientation model, and find it necessary to adopt a more complicated 
conceptual model in order to accommodate the sequence of sense impressions. It 
remains true that the simple orientation model applies over sufficiently small 
ranges of states, but the sense impressions corresponding to each orientation 
may vary as a function of three additional state variables, which in 
conventional terms represent the spatial position of the observer. Like the 
orientation variables, these translation variables, which we might label $x, y,$ 
and $z$, change only incrementally from one state to the next, but unlike the 
orientation variables there is no apparent periodicity.


Note that the success of this process of induction relies on a stratification of 
experiences, allowing the orientation effects to be discerned first, more or less 
independent of the translation effects. Then, once the orientation model has been 
established, the relatively small deviations from it (over small ranges of the 
state variable) could be interpreted as the effects of translatory motion. If not 
for this stratification (either in magnitude or in some other attribute), it 
might never be possible to infer the distinct sources of variation in our sense 
impressions. (On a more subtle level, the detailed metrical aspects of these 
translation variables will also be found to differ from those of the orientation 
variables, but only after quantitative units of measure and coordinates have been 
established.)

 
Another stage in the development of our hypothetical observer might be prompted 
by the detection of still more complicated variations in the experiential 
attributes of successive states. The observer may notice that while most of the 
orientation space is consistent with a fixed position, some particular features 
of their sense impressions do not maintain their expected relations to the other 
features, and no combination of the observer’s translation and orientation 
variables can restore consistency. The inferred external objects of perception 
can no longer be modeled based on the premise that their relations with respect 
to each other are unchanging. Significantly, the observer may notice that some 
features vary as would be expected if the observer’s own positional state had 
changed in one way, whereas other features vary as would be expected if the 
observer’s positions had changed in a different way. From this recognition the 
observer concludes that, just as he himself can translate through the space, so 
also can individual external objects, and the relations are reciprocal. Thus, to 
each object we now assign an independent set of translation coordinates for each 
state of the observer.

 

In so doing we have made another important conceptual choice, namely, to regard 
"external objects" as having individual identities that persist from one state to 
the next. Other interpretations are possible. For example, we could account for 
the apparent motion of objects by supposing that one external entity simply 
ceases to exist, and another similar entity in a slightly different position 
comes into existence. According to this view, there would be no such thing as 
motion, but simply a sequence of arrangements of objects with some similarities. 
This may seem obtuse, but according to quantum mechanics it actually is not 
possible to unambiguously map the identities of individual elementary particles 
(such as electrons) from one event to another (because their wave functions 
overlap). Thus the seemingly innocuous assumption of continuous and persistent 
identities for material objects through time is actually, on some level, 
demonstrably false. However, on the macroscopic level, physical objects do seem 
to maintain individual identities, or at least it is possible to successfully 
model our sense impressions based on the assumption of persistent identities 
(because the overlaps between wave functions are negligible), and this success is 
the justification for introducing the concept of motion for the objects of 
experience.

 

The conceptual model of our hypothetical observer now involves something that we 
may call distance, related to the translational state variables, but it’s worth 
noting that we have no direct perception of distances between ourselves and the 
assumed external objects, and even less between one external object and another. 
We have only our immediate sense impressions, which are understood to be purely 
local interactions, involving signals of some kind impinging on our senses. We 
infer from these signals a conceptual model of space and time within which 
external objects reside and move. This model actually entails two distinct kinds 
of extent, which we may call distance and length. An object, consisting of a 
locus of sense impressions that maintains a degree of coherence over time, has a 
spatial length, as do the paths that objects may follow in their motions, but the 
conceptual model of space also allows us to conceive of a distance between two 
objects, defined as the length of the shortest possible path between them.

 

The task of quantifying these distances, and of relating the orientation 
variables with the translation variables, then involves further assumptions. 
Since this is a passive model, all changes are strictly known only as a function 
of the single state variable, but we imagine other pseudo-independent variables 
based on the observed correlations. We have two means of quantifying spatial 
distances. One is by observing the near coincidence of one or more stable 
entities (measuring rods) with the interval to be quantified, and the other is to 
observe the change in the internal state variable as an object of stable speed 
moves from one end of the interval to the other. Thus we can quantify a spatial 
interval in terms of some reference spatial interval, or in terms of the 
associated temporal interval based on some reference state of motion. We identify 
these references purely by induction based on experience.

 

Combining the rotational symmetries and the apparent translational distances that 
we infer from our primary sense impressions, we conventionally arrive at a 
conception of the external world that is, in some sense, the dual of our 
subjective experience. In other words, we interpret our subjective experience as 
a one-dimensional temporally-ordered sequence of events, whereas we conceive of 
"the objective world now" corresponding to a single perceived event as a three-
dimensional expanse of space as illustrated below:

#align(center,
image("../images/s11_1.svg", width: 56%)
)

In this way we intuitively conceive of time and space as inherently perpendicular 
dimensions, but complications arise if we posit that each event along our 
subjective path resides in, and is an element of, an objective world. If the 
events along any path are discrete, then we might imagine a simple sequence of 
discrete "instantaneous worlds":

#align(center,
image("../images/s11_2.svg", width: 56%)
)
 
One difficulty with this arrangement is that it isn't clear how (or whether) 
these worlds interact with each other. If we regard each "instant" as a complete 
copy of the spatial universe, separate from every other instant, then there seems 
to be no definite way to identify an object in one world with "the same" object 
in another, particularly considering qualitatively identical objects such as 
electrons. If we have two electrons assigned the labels $A$ and $B$ in one instant of 
time, and if we find two electrons in the next instant of time, we have no 
certain way of deciding which of them was the $A$ electron from the previous 
instant. (In fact, we cannot even map the spatial locations of one instant to 
"the same" locations in any other instant.) This illustrates how the classical 
concept of motion is necessarily based on the assumption of persistent identities 
of objects from one instant to another.  Since it does seem possible (at least in 
the classical realm) to organize our experiences in terms of individual objects 
with persistent and unambiguous identities over time, we may be led to suspect 
that the sequence of existence of an individual or object in any one instant must 
be, in some sense, connected to or contiguous with its existence in neighboring 
instants. If these objects are the constituents of "the world", this suggests 
that space itself at any "instant" is continuous with the spaces of neighboring 
instants. This is important because it implies a definite connectivity between 
neighboring world-spaces, and this, as we'll see, places a crucial constraint on 
the relativity of motion.

 

Another complication concerns the relative orderings of world-instants along 
different paths.  Our schematic above implied that the "instantaneous worlds" are 
well-ordered in the sense that they are encountered in the same order along every 
individual's path, but of course this need not be the case. For example, we could 
equally well imagine an arrangement in which the "instantaneous worlds" are 
skewed, so that different individuals encounter them in different orders, as 
illustrated below.

#align(center,
image("../images/s11_3.svg", width: 35%)
)

The concept of motion assumes the world can be analyzed in two different ways, 
first as the union of a set of mutually exclusive "events", and second as a set 
of "objects" each of which participates in an ordered sequence of events. In 
addition to this ordering of events encountered by each individual object, we 
must also assume both a co-lateral ordering of the events associated with 
different objects, and a transverse ordering of events from one object to 
another. These three kinds of orderings are illustrated schematically below.

#align(center,
image("../images/s11_4.svg", width: 85%)
)

 

This diagram suggests that the idea of motion is actually quite complex, even in 
this simple abstract model. Intuitively we regard motion as something like the 
derivative of the spatial "position" with respect to "time", but we can't even 
unambiguously define the distance between two worldlines, because it depends on 
how we correlate the temporal ordering along one line to the temporal ordering 
along the other. Essentially _our concept of motion is overly ambitious,_ because 
we want it to express the spatial distance from the observer to the object for 
each event along the observer's worldline, but the intervals from one worldline 
to another are not confined to the worldlines themselves, so we have no definite 
way of assigning those intervals to events along our worldline. The best we can 
do is correlate all the intervals from a particular point on the observer's 
worldline to the object's worldline.

 

When we considered everything in terms of the sense impressions of just a single 
observer this was not an issue, since only one parameterization was needed to map 
the experiences of that observer, interpreted solipsistically. Any convenient 
parameterization was suitable. When we go on to consider multiple observers and 
objects we can still allow each observer to map his experiences and internal 
states using the most convenient terms of reference (which will presumably 
include his own state-index as the temporal coordinate), but now the question 
arises as to how all these private coordinate systems are related to each other. 
To answer this question we need to formalize our parameterizations into abstract 
systems of coordinates, and then consider how the coordinates of any given event 
with respect to one system are related to the coordinates of the same event with 
respect to another system. This is discussed in the next section.


Considering how far removed from our raw sense impressions is our conceptual 
model of the external world, and how many _unjustified_ assumptions and 
interpolations are involved in its construction, it’s easy to see why some 
philosophers have advocated the _rejection_ of _all_ conceptual models. However, the 
fact remains that the imperative to reconcile our experience with some model of 
an objective external world has been one of the most important factors guiding 
the development of physical theories. Even in quantum mechanics, arguably the 
field of physics most resistant to complete realistic reconciliation, we still 
rely on the "correspondence principle", according to which the observables of the 
theory must conform to the observables of classical realistic models in the 
appropriate limits. Naturally our interpretations of experience are always 
provisional, being necessarily based on incomplete induction, but conceptual 
models of an objective world have proven (so far) to be indispensable.
