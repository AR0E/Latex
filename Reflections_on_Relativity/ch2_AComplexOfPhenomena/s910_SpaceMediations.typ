We were on the steamer from America to Japan, and I 
liked to take part in the social life on the steamer 
and, so, for instance, I took part in the dances in the 
evening. Paul, somehow, didn't like that too much but 
he would sit in a chair and look at the dances. Once I 
came back from a dance and took the chair beside him 
and he asked me, "Heisenberg, why do you dance?" I 
said, "Well, when there are nice girls, it is a 
pleasure to dance." He thought for a long time about 
it, and after about five minutes he said, "Heisenberg, 
how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?
