== The Inertia of Energy <InerEnergy>

#blockquote[
Please reveal who you are of such fearsome form... I 
wish to clearly know you, the primeval being, because I 
cannot fathom your intention. Lord Krishna said: I am 
terrible Time, destroyer of all beings in all worlds, 
here to destroy this world. Of those heroic soldiers 
now arrayed in the opposing army, even without you, 
none will be spared.

---Bhagavad Gita
