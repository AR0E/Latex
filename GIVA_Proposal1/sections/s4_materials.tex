\chapter{Materials and Methods}

Due to the nature of the research being only a software endeavour, no
extra materials will be necessary (besides coffee!).

\section{Methodology}

Activities related to literature review (A1, A2) and study/research (A3, A7)
will be carried out by the scholarship recipient without a predefined structure; weekly meetings between the scholarship recipient
and the advisor will be used to guide the direction of the research in order to maintain the schedule.
Activities related to development (A4, A5, A8) will be carried out mainly by the
scholarship recipient, with monitoring by the advisor through version control systems (VCS),
in addition to the aforementioned weekly meetings. Activities
related to scientific writing or publication (A6, A9, A10) will be carried out by the scholarship recipient and reviewed
by the advisor.
