\chapter{Objectives}

\section{Reproduction of State-of-the-Art}

Of our main goals, the first is a complete implementation of the
\textit{already} existing literature, in an open-source fashion, such
that the operators and algorithms can be easily used by both the \textit{GIVA} Lab
as well as other interested researchers and industry professionals.
