\begin{itemize}
    \item A1. Initial literature review and definition of the problem;
    
    \item A2. Continuous monitoring of relevant literature;
    
    \item A3. Study and research to determine the SSI approach to be used, aiming for a trade-off between geometric accuracy  performance â€” acquiring familiarity with GPU
    processing.
    
    \item A4. Development and implementation of the tools on which the numerical methods adopted by the approach chosen in activity A3 will be based (AA framework, spatial acceleration structures on CPU and GPU, etc.);
    
    \item A5. Development and open-source implementation of the selected
    mesh operators;
    
    \item A6. Writing the text for the qualification exam required by the institution;
