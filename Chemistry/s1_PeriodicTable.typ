= The Celestial Periodic Table

Why remember these when speaking of chemistry? It quickly became apparent that, of the
too many ambiguities in the language of men who work with flasks speaking of things
_prima mater_, certain (laborious and time consuming) confusions arose 
when translating from computational to practical settings. Nowhere is the _correspondence principle_ 
more viciously assaultedthan in a chemistry laboratory (thank the heavens!).

=== Back to basics

Let us return to basic quantum theory, the one of enlightened men such as_ Peres_ or
_Neumaier_. A quantum system $ket(psi)$, defined by some equivalence class of preparations
and the notions of the good book, defines such a thing as an _atomic state_ as whatever
it is we consider an atomic measurement:

The ambiguity of these notions emerges as soon as we think of concrete
examples. Is a hydrogen atom in a $2p$ state the same system as one in a $1s$
state? Or is it the _same _system as a hydrogen atom in a $1s$ state
accompanied
by a photon? The answer depends on the problem in which we are interested:
energy levels or transition rates. In a Stern-Gerlach experiment, we have seen
(page 17) that the “quantum system” (...) is only
the magnetic moment $mu$ of that atom, because the goal of the Stern-Gerlach
test is to determine a component of $mu$. The center of mass of the atom can
be treated classically. These examples show that we must be content with a
vague “definition”: _A quantum system is whatever admits a closed dynamical
description within quantum theory._

Good. Now for some other standard facts, if an electron $A$ admits states
$(ket(a_1), ket(a_2))$, and a proton $B$ admits $(ket(b_1), ket(b_2))$,
total composite "electron-proton" or "hydrogen" states $ket(c)$ are of the form:

$
ket(c) = alpha(ket(a_1) times.circle ket(b_1)) + beta(ket(a_2) times.circle ket(b_2))
$

Where, evidently, we cannot distinguish the forms of states $A$ and $B$ no longer,
and can only produce tests that measure the observables associated to $C$, the hydrogen
system. This is a strongly correlated system. 

=== Of angular momenta

=== Strings in $S O(4)$, the Hydrogen solutions



For a hydrogen atom with spin, in the non-relativistic setting,
the Hamiltonian is a somewhat complicated construction in terms of
the conjugate momenta and spin vector, but ultimately reduces to
a corrected energy of @hydrogen_withSpin:

$
E_n = -m/(2hbar^2) (k_1+ mu k_2 s_r hbar)^2/(n plus.minus mu s_r)^2
$

Of interest is only to know the order of this correction.
The $mu$ terms contain a magnitude of one unit of action, meaning
we could expect deviations $~5"eV"$ from spin-coupling interactions.


=== Splitting and extra effects

We won't devote too much time to the theory of individual atomic
effects.
