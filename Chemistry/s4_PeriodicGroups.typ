== Relevant Periodic Groups

=== Alkaline metals

The properties of this are the symplest to analyze; alkaline
atoms are effectively "disturbed hydrogens" due to the effective
screened nuclei charge. 


=== Alkaline-earth metals

Some of the basic periodic properties are considered when
looking at Slater's method. 



=== Reactive Nonmetals

The energy integrals are:

$
&D: J(n 11; n 11) = F^0 (n 1;n 1) + 1/25 F^2(n 1; n 1) \
&P: J(n 11; n 10) - K(n 11; n 10) = F^0 (n 1;n 1) - 2/25 F^2(n 1; n 1) -
3/25 G^2(n 1; n 1)
